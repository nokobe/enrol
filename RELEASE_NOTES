version 3.0.4 fixed IE7/IE8 login issue

version 3.0.3 fixed IE7/IE8 button issue

version 3.0.2 minor fixes
	- removed customisations from Logger Class
	- switched logInfo to logDebug for a number of calls
	- reenabled debug_backtrace
	- fixed modal display not showing up during auth attempt
	- minor bugfixes

version 3.0.1 Added Audit(log) Class
	- added function to Sessions Class: describeSession()
	- added function logAudit, which adds custom fields and then passes to Audit Logger
	  (goal here is to strip customisation of Logger - Logger was trying to add custom
	  information, but the calls to get that info were themselves logging...)
	- put stand-alone utility functions into toolbox.php

version 3.0 rebadged version 2.3.2-exp.17 ready for release

version 2.3.2-exp.17 minor tweaks preparing for major release
	- bring hasAdminAuth() to top of manageNotices.php
	- protect enrol() unenrol() with isLoggedIn() check
	- put alert models in column with Sessions
	- change "Show Admin Functions' to just: "Admin Mode"
	- show no-sessions message when no sessions.

version 2.3.2-exp.16 improved log message format and made them consistent over all functions
	- customised Logger to fetch username for automatic inclusion in all logging
	- Logger target now correctly set via config

version 2.3.2-exp.15 made ManageSessions class more self-contained
	(makes for cleaner code)
	- added global exception handler
	- moved manageSessions operations to be fully within the class.
	- eg. load and save are handled as necessary with the class.
	- remove last last of the deprecated code from enrol.php
	- changed Sessions Class to be ManageSessions Class
	  (now it matches the fill name!)
	- made manageSessions sort function static
	NOTE. Still not doing file locking

version 2.3.2-exp.14 implemented edit Announcements
	- added yoga image (but need to change this to be controlled via the
	  config, but for now, it is hard coded in)
	- some minor bugfixes

version 2.3.2-exp.13 Added Announcements, which stay at the top of page
        Note:
	- need to hide "well" when announcements is empty
	- need to implment edit Announcements

version 2.3.2-exp.12 Implemented adminRemove function + a few minor bugfixes

version 2.3.2-exp.11
	- removed deprecated code, including log_event (now uses Logger::logInfo)
	- replaced lousy function weeknumber2monday() with getPreviousMonday() (much better!, WWIT)
	- protect display of username with htmlentities()
	  (I had done this previously but that had been lost along the way)
	- Coded display of active tab based on template variable $t->activetab
	- Moved tabs back down from login/top bar back into main page
	- Trial display of Announcements data at top of page as separate to the
	  notices data displayed in the Notices tab.

version 2.3.2-exp.10 Implementation (almost?) complete. Various bugfixes
	- implemented editNotices
	  removed old-style formatting of notices (don't get in the way of bootstrap!)
	- implemented weekly sub-heading for sessions
	- added new config option:
		forceAdminAuth: determines whether admin users need to authenticate immediately or not
	- eliminated old code from enrol.php
	- fix bug where superfluous row was shown when class size % 6 == 0
	- added javascript check for createNewSession
	- continued to replace old debug/log calls with calls to Logger class
	  (I think remaining calls are in sections of redundant code anyway)
	- log level now set from the config.inc.php
	- log_event() now superceded by Logger::logInfo()
	- logger::logTrace() now actually reports up to two levels of the stack backtrace
	- shows by default!
	- changed label: "Admin View" to "Show Admin Functions" and groups admin functions in a "well"
	- removed superflous "Admin" tab-pane
	Still to be fixed:
	- tried (and so far failed) to add javascript "Are you sure?" confirmation to session delete
	- stopped forcing Sessions-tab as default - but now neither Sessions nor Information tab

version 2.3.2-exp.9 added Admin authentication. fine tuning codebase.
	- admin username and password now comes from local config file
	- fixed erroneous use of === when returning 0 rather than false!
	- (and changed the return value to be false for good measure!)
	- moved calls to SessionMgr to be outside main loop
	- finally implemented Logger class. Starting rolling out it's use
	- added configuration item: forceAdminAuth -- determines whether Admins are
	  required to authenticate immediately on login.
	- removed deprecated config item: admin_user

version 2.3.2-exp.8 major dev checkpoint. all functions implemented
	- debug code gets ugly.. there are some raw file_put_contents!
	- admin passwords are stored via hardcoded hash!
	- admin functions now require authentication
	- probably should force admin users to authenticate immediately so that
	  their use really is reserved for admins
	- Otherwise, remaining functions completed. Create session. Delete
	  session.

version 2.3.2-exp.7 major dev checkpoint. most functions implmented
	- color adjustments
	- moved some functions into central "functions.php" file
	- fix buttons to open and close sessions
	- implemented enrol and unenrol user in manageSessions Class
	- implemented open and close session functions is manageSessions Class
	- implemented edit session
	- protected username display with htmlentities()
	- cleaned/simplified functions in datetime.php
	- fixed: class places weren't all displaying correctly
	   (well, mostly fixed. I think it now adds an unnecessary row
	   if the number of places is mod 6)


version 2.3.2-exp.6 changed colours. shows notices. added debug CI
	- trying different colour scheme
	- added get_notices() (makes print_notices() obsolete
	- added debug configuration value and hide some ugly debug prints behind it
	- added file: deploy.830d

version 2.3.2-exp.5 working template-based layout and showing class enrolments
	added prepareSessionData() to prepare data for the template to display
	added a bunch of functions to handle class operations..
	and threatened to write a SessionsClass class but it's too
	bit a change to commit to at this point, thought it would
	certainly help simplify many of the sessions operations!.

2.3.2-exp.4 mid-dev version. old-style works. template-style not complete
	reworked many things! including...
	- put all the start crud into a global.inc
	- eliminate globals by using a config class (though at times the
	  config itself is accessed as a global - unless until I finish
	  my proper ConfigurationManager
	  (except for "admin_mode" which is still in the process of being
	  replaced by calls to SessionMgr class)
	- created SessionMgr to track user login, session and cookie info
	  and encapsulate it. Must now come here to check username of logged
	  in user, etc.
	- since SessionMgr is now tracking the user, removed obsolete
	  hidden Name field from all the forms
	- eliminated redundant (and confusing) session->whenstr. All times a session date 
	  needs to be presented, it is cast at the time.
	- yes, I did change the base indent-level of much of the code in enrol.php.
	  Sorry about that.
	- eliminated silly "save changes" return parameter when LOADING session file

2.3.2-exp.3 (version not updated as only new templates have changed)
	basically a nice checkpoint in the template design.
	Looks quite good. Template responds to values such as $loggedIn
	and $admin (probably should be called $isLoggedIn and $isAdmin)

2.3.2-exp.3
	removed style.css
	added bootstrap styling links
	starting building template

2.3.2-exp.2
	begin bootstrap styling
	reduce table chome. more compact date display. etc.

2.3.2-exp.1
	uses SESSION rather than cookie (uses cookie if "remember me" clicked)
	uses top-bar for user login (no password required)
	top-bar shows bread-crumb of current action
	hides other admin buttons and functions when editing
	edit Notices now shows rendered version above edit box
	javascript code for show/hide Admin Functions
	javascript code for show/hide Closed Sessions
	show/hide functions are currently available via an "Admin Toolbox"
	however the javascript state is not yet retained - want to put this
	state information into the SESSION to do that.

2.3.2-exp
	uses array of nominated admins, rather than special admin user
	remove button changed to "remove me" to match "add me" button
	added AdminRemove function
	cleared out unused config vars
	cleared out old table layout code
	made colours more basic (eg. bg now white)

2.3.2
	fix reference/access to REMOTE_ADDR

2.3.1
	bugfix: fix logged errors when $status was empty

2.3 Bugfixes plus some file/dir layout improvements
	Bugfix: fixed KNOWN ISSUE where admin functions didn't work in Firefox
	minor reworking of files/directories for better layout and security
	- eg. config.inc now called config.inc.php
	(was due to firefox changing the wasy POST values were submitted for images)
	Now uses popup alert if class becomes full between loading and enroling
	New config item allows conditionals based on PROD or TEST etc.
	- eg. now shows Reload button (for easier testing) but only if not in Production mode

2.2.2
	fix: set default timezone to avoid warnings/errors on newer versions of php

2.2.1
	change minutes interval from 10 to 15 (eg. shows 0,15,30,45)
	fixed: 12:xxPM was reverting to 12:xxAM on edit/load
2.2
	sessions display in multiple rows (configurable number per row)
	after actions performed, now will jump back to the same location on the page
	option (default: hide) to hide Session ID (only relevent when in admin mode)
	migrate more settings into css
	print new header with each week: "Sessions for week beginning Monday xx of xx"
	use smaller fonts (can set in style.css)
	some minor tweaks

	KNOWN ISSUES: Admin functions dont seem to work in IE8. Don't know why not.

2.1.1	fixed: "Set" and "Clear" are logging as "unknown actions"
	fixed: tooltips on admin icons now work
	hide Reload button

2.1	added ability to reset SessionID if total session count is zero.
	slight tweaks to formatting to aid compatibility with IE8
	add credits to footer (including credits for icons)
	some minor tweaks
