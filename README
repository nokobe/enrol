Non-authenticated enrolment program
Language: php

Admin Usage

	Simple configuration file for easily customisating and deployment
	Easy to add new sessions
	Session can easily be set to Open (visible), Closed (Invisible) or Deleted
	Sessions are automatically shown in date order
	An event log is kept, which matches each operation to an IP address

User usage

	Very simply and straight-foward for the user to enrol/unenroll in sessions
	User simply sets their name, (which is kept in a cookie), then
	can then enrol or unenroll in any of the currently open sessions.

Other Notes

	To avoid conflicts, the Session ID is ALWAYS incremented for new sessions.
	However, if there are no sessions in the database, the program will offer
	the option to reset the SessionID to 1. However, this should be use
	discretion using this option.
